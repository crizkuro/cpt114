You need to write a program for a wedding planner. They wish to create a gift registry for each couple. Each person brings only one gift. They want the gifts broken down by the whether the gift giver is on the bride side or groom side. They also want to track particular gifts: toasters, silverware, and stemware. They want those gifts listed and have the name of the gift giver under them. The following is an example of the output they wish.


Assumptions

only three tracked items
do not need to track items not on the list

toasters
silverware
stemware

Inputs

guestName
guestGift
giftFor

Calculations

tracked items function
if gift = tracked
	(itemVar) = (itemVar) + name


main function
while loopRun = true
	if giftFor = bride
		if brideGuestNum = 0
			brideGuestNum++
			brideList = brideGuestNum + ": Bride Gifts: <br />" + guestName + ": " + guestGift
		else
			brideGuestNum++
			brideList = "<br />" + brideGuestNum + ": " + guestName + ": " + guestGift
	else
		if groomGuestNum = 0
			groomGuestNum++
			groomList = groomGuestNum + ": Groom Gifts: <br />" + guestName + ": " + guestGift
		else
			brideGuestNum++
			groomList = "<br />" + groomGuestNum + ": " + guestName + ": " + guestGift




Output

brideList
groomList
guestToaster 
guestSilverware 
guestStemware
