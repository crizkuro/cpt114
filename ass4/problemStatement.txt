You have been tasked with writing a program for a automotive junk yard.  They want to encourage their customers to make large purchases ($1000 or more) and to place their order online.  To do this they have set up a discount system for their customers to use.   If a customer orders online they get a 5 percent discount.  If the customer orders online and the order is $1000 or more they get an additional 10 percent off their order (total of 15%).  If their customer does not order online the only discount they provide is a 5 percent discount for orders that are $1000 or more.  Sales tax is 8 percent.  They want to be able to see the initial amount of the order, the the amount of online discount, the amount of 1000 and over discount, total amount of discounts, the subtotal (initial order minus the discount), the amount of sales tax and the grand total.



Assumption
only three types of discounts
does not need daily or weekly totals

lgOrderQualifier      = 1000
lgOrderBaseDiscount   = .05
onlineDiscountRate    = .05
lgOnlineDiscountRate  = .10
salesTax              = 0.8

Input

orderAmt
isOnlineOrder


Calculations

if isOnlineOrder == true then
	if orderAmt >= lgOrderQualifier then
		onlineDiscountAmt  = orderAmt * onlineDiscountRate
		lgOrderDiscountAmt = orderAmt * lgOnlineDiscountRate
		totalDiscountAmt   = onlineDiscountAmt + lgOrderDiscountAmt
	else
		onlineDiscountAmt  = orderAmt * onlineDiscountRate
		totalDiscountAmt   = onlineDiscountAmt
else if orderAmt >= lgOrderQualifier then
	lgOrderDiscountAmt  = orderAmt * lgOrderBaseDiscount
	totalDiscountAmt    = lgOrderDiscountAmt
else
	totalDiscountAmt = 0

subTotal    = orderAmt - totalDiscountAmt
taxAmt      = subTotal * salesTax
grandTotal  = subTotal - taxAmt


Output

orderAmt
onlineDiscountAmt
lgOrderDiscountAmt
totalDiscountAmt
subTotal
taxAmt
grandTotal
