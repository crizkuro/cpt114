You have been asked to write a property tax program for the tri-county area.  If you live in Charleston county then you owe 1 percent of your home's value if it's less than or equal to $50,000.  You owe 1.50 percent if it's greater than $50,000 but not greater than $150,000 and 2 percent if it's greater than $150,00.  If you live in Dorchester county then you owe 1.25 percent of your home's value if it's less than or equal to $50,000.  You owe 1.50 percent if it's greater than $50,000 but not greater than $150,000 and 1.75 percent if it's greater than $150,000.  If you live in Berkeley county then you owe 2 percent of your home's value if it's less than or equal to $50,000 of value, 2.25 percent if it's greater than $50,000 but not greater than $150,000 and 2.75 percent if it's greater than $150,000.


Assumption

each county has its own tax rates
all three counties share tax groups
there are three tax groups

lowValue = 50000
highValue = 150000

taxGroup

chsCountyRate1 = .01
chsCountyRate2 = .015
chsCountyRate3 = .02

dorCountyRate1 = .0125
dorCountyRate2 = .015
dorCountyRate3 = .0175

berkCountyRate1 = .02
berkCountyRate2 = .0225
berkCountyRate3 = .0275


Input

propValue
propCounty


Calculations

if propValue <= lowValue
	taxGroup = 1
else if propValue > highValue
	taxGroup = 3
else
	taxGroup = 2

if propCounty == "Charleston"
	if taxGroup == 1
		taxOwed = propValue * chsCountyRate1
	if taxGroup == 2
		taxOwed = propValue * chsCountyRate2
	if taxGroup == 3
		taxOwed = propValue * chsCountyRate3
else if propCounty == "Dorchester"
	if taxGroup == 1
		taxOwed = propValue * dorCountyRate1
	if taxGroup == 2
		taxOwed = propValue * dorCountyRate2
	if taxGroup == 3
		taxOwed = propValue * dorCountyRate3
else if propCounty == "Berkeley"
	if taxGroup == 1
		taxOwed = propValue * berkCountyRate1
	if taxGroup == 2
		taxOwed = propValue * berkCountyRate2
	if taxGroup == 3
		taxOwed = propValue * berkCountyRate3


Output

propValue
propCounty
taxOwed
