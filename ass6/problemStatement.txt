You have been hired by the local county fair stand to write a program that will allow them to keep track of the sale of their grilled goods. The grilled goods section sells types of hamburgers, hot dogs, corn dogs and nachos. Hamburgers are $4, hot dogs are $2, Corn dogs are $3 and nachos are $5.00. Strangely enough, a customer can only order one type of item (hotdog, nachos, etc) per visit but they can order as many of that item as they want.  Because of this constraint you want to ask the user which type of food they want and then how many of that food item. At the end of the day a report is provided.


Assumption

only four types of grilled items

Hamburgers price = 4
Hot dogs price = 2
Corn dogs price = 3
nachos price = 5


Input

type item (hamburger, hot dog, corn dog, nachos)
count orderd
another customer?

Calculations

if type item = "hamburger"
	Amount hamburgers + count orderd
if type item = "hot dog"
	Amount hot dogs + count orderd
if type item = "corn dog"
	Amount corn dogs + count orderd
if type item = "nachos"
	Amount nachos + count orderd


total price Hamburgers = Amount Hamburgers * Hamburgers price
total price Hot dogs = Amount Hot dogs * Hot dogs price
total price Corn dogs = Amount Corn dogs * Corn dogs price
total price nachos = Amount nachos * nachos price

total = total price Hamburgers + total price Hot dogs + total price Corn dogs + total price nachos

Output

Amount hamburgers
Amount hot dogs
Amount corn dogs
Amount nachos
total price Hamburgers
total price Hot dogs
total price Corn dogs
total price nachos
