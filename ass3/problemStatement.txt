You have been asked to write a computer program for a entertainment center. They have sell their tickets at two separate  prices.  Tickets are $10 a piece except for their "early bird" movies which cost only $5 a ticket.   At the entertainment center they offer all patrons dinner along with the movie.  The cost of dinner is $8 during the week and $12 during the weekend.   All customers must pay for both dinner and the movie.   At the end of the order a receipt is printed showing:  Number of Tickets, price per ticket, price per dinner, cost of dinner and ticket, total amount owed.  



Assumption
there are only two price points for tickets
there are only two price points for dinners
program will not store all recepits for book keeping
recepits can have multipe guests

tickFull = 10
tickEB = 5
dinner = 8
dinnerWE = 12

Input

numGuests
isEarlyBird
isWeekEnd


Calculations

if isEarlyBird = true
tickCostPer = tickEB
else
tickCostPer = tickFull

if isWeekEnd = true
dinCostPer = dinnerWE
else
dinCostPer = dinner

totalCostPer = dinCostPer + tickCostPer
totalOwed = totalCostPer * numGuests

Output

numGuests
tickCostPer
dinCostPer
totalCostPer
